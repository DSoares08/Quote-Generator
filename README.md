# Quote Generator

[inspire](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) quote generator is a minimal web application to read quotes and share them online. It fetches the data from the Quotes API from API Ninjas.

## Problem

Many people enjoy having their daily inspirational quote. This tool keeps it simple and you get a nice Aston Martin in the background :)

## Steps 

I first created the React app and made sure I had it set up with all the necessary tools (Tailwind CSS). Then, I fetched the relevant information from the API and displayed it in a card component. Finally, I just had to style everything and make sure that the Twitter link was functional.

## Decisions

Keeping a minimalistic design is at the heart of the project and it was a great way to complement the wallpaper in the background.

## Summary

The project was a great way to polish my skills with frontend technologies whilst delivering an impactful user experience.
